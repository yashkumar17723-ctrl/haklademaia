Project Concept: NeuroBeat (AI-Powered Music Therapy for Parkinson’s & Stroke)
Vision

A clinical-grade, AI-driven neurorehabilitation companion that uses personalized rhythmic beats, music, and waveforms to improve motor control, gait, speech, and fine motor recovery in Parkinson’s and stroke patients.

The core principle: auditory-motor entrainment — synchronizing movement to rhythm to bypass damaged neural pathways.

How It Works: The Clinical Loop

Baseline Assessment

Phone sensors or clinician input measure walking cadence, hand tapping speed, or speech rhythm.

Establishes a patient’s baseline tempo.

Personalized Rhythmic Prescription

Clinician dashboard sets a target beat (e.g., 10% above baseline).

AI generates music/metronome/soothing wave beats aligned to tempo.

Patients can choose music, pure beats, or ambient waves for therapy.

Therapeutic Session Delivery

Beats/music delivered through headphones.

Patient synchronizes steps, speech, or movements with rhythm.

Modes:

Walk Trainer (step-to-beat)

Speech Rhythm (guided syllables)

Relaxation/Balance (slow waves + breathing cues)

Fine Motor Tapping (gamified drum/keyboard interface)

Adaptive Feedback (Closed-Loop AI)

Phone sensors track movement accuracy.

System auto-adjusts BPM in real time to keep patient in sync.

Progressively increases difficulty when patient improves.

Progress Tracking

Session logs show cadence, accuracy, and improvements.

Clinicians see dashboards with trends in gait speed, speech clarity, and adherence.

Patients get gamified feedback (e.g., “You improved step accuracy by 12% today!”).

Key Features

✅ Auto-Adjust Engine – Music tempo adapts dynamically to patient performance.
✅ Multiple Beat Types – Metronome ticks, musical rhythms, or ambient waveforms.
✅ Gamified Motor Exercises – Virtual drum/keyboard for hand rehab.
✅ Patient-Friendly UI – Clean, high-contrast, voice-guided interface with big buttons.
✅ Clinician Dashboard – Remote monitoring, therapy adjustments, and detailed reports.
✅ TeleRehab Ready – Works at home with just a smartphone.

MVP for Hackathon Demo

Gait Trainer Module for Parkinson’s patients.

Mock cadence input → AI-generated beat/music at prescribed tempo.

Real-time BPM auto-adjust + simple graph for progress.

Two interfaces:

Patient view (Start button + beat + progress meter).

Clinician view (Set tempo + track progress).

Impact

Empowers patients with accessible home therapy.

Reduces clinician workload through automation.

Data-driven rehab with clear measurable outcomes.

Potential to reduce falls, improve walking speed, and restore fine motor skills.

⚡This positions NeuroBeat not just as an app, but as a scalable digital therapeutic tool — bridging AI, music, and clinical rehab.
